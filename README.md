# G-LOC Detection using STM32 and MEMS

This project focuses on detecting G-LOC (G-force-induced Loss Of Consciousness) using an STM32H556ZI NUCLEO board and the X-NUCLEO-MEMS Expansion pack. The project leverages the onboard MEMS sensor to monitor and detect high G-force conditions that may lead to G-LOC, commonly encountered in high-performance aviation or racing scenarios.

## Requirements

- **Hardware:**
  - STM32H556ZI NUCLEO Board
  - X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 MEMS Expansion Board (or compatible MEMS sensor for STM32)
  
- **Software:**
  - STM32CubeIDE (latest version)
  - STM32CubeMX (for configuration and initialization)
  - STM32 HAL Libraries (included in CubeMX)
